# All The Clothes v1.4.0
Author: RaiRaiTheRaichu
Original Authors: JustNU, Senko, Ereshkigal, Baliston

### ---BUILT FOR AKI VERSION 3.7.0---

Inspired and built upon SellScavSuits, this mod adds all Scav/Raider/Boss etc clothing to unlock from Fence. You can navigate to the Services tab at the top of Fence's trade screen to view all the new clothing! 

Furthermore, check out the mod's config.json for more options! You can remove all the unlock requirements (some clothing requires quests, skills, items, and levels!), change them to whatever you'd like, and toggle some new features that allow you to fully customize your character further than ever before!

You can:
- Choose scav and boss voices for your PMC!
- Choose scav and boss faces for your PMC! (Only available at profile creation - see "Swapping Heads" to change head models on existing profiles.)
- Choose any faction voice for your PMC! Play as a USEC with a Bear voice (including the new English Bear voices!) or vice versa!
- Choose any faction clothing for your PMC! Dress in your favorite Bear clothing as a USEC, or dress up as a USEC as a Bear!
- Disable the unlock requirements for all these new Scav/Boss clothes! Wear whatever you want right at the start for maximum roleplay!
- Come up with your own unlocks and rebalance them however you'd like!

If you'd like to rename some of the new clothing/head/voices, the localization can be found within "./db/locale.json".
Remember, you can change your voice at any time in the game's Settings, in the Audio tab.

Feel free to leave a comment or contact me using Discord if you have any suggestions or have any issues!

## ---SWAPPING HEADS---

Make sure your server is shut down!

Open your profile's .json located within `user/profiles` with any text editor (preferably Notepad ++).

Look for a line starting with `"Head": `, which should be near the top, right below `"Customization": {`.

Swap the ID for the head for any of the following, and save your profile:
