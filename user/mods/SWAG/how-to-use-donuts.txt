# DONUTS - How-To

All presets spawn PMCs in their actual live locations*


By default, there is a lot of intentional variance is all presets - this is so that each raid is unpredictable. One raid may be pretty quiet, while the next could be a 15-kill PMC raid and everything in-between. If you prefer a more consistent experience then please try the different presets and see if they are a better fit for you (described below)**


* only applicable to presets that include starting PMC spawns

** any preset not included in the random pool must be manually selected before a raid!


live-like (selected randomly by default)

A preset that is "live-like" with a little extra action.


live-like-alt (selected randomly by default)

Similar to live-like but with some twists - some spawn points have different spawn chances. For example, live-like-alt may be more likely to spawn PMCs inside IDEA on Interchange, or outside of Dorms in the woods instead of inside, etc.


quietraids (selected randomly by default)

Less spawn variance, most spawns will likely NOT trigger - perhaps you're a newer player or you just like to loot n chill in tarky, then this preset is for you.


boss-mania

"live-like" but with more bosses. Goons on Labs, Tagilla in Interchange and more. However - they don't spawn right away like normal, they're dynamically spawned by Donuts. All PMC and SCAV spawns are included but spawn chances have been reduced for balance. Not for the faint of heart. Highly recommend cranking up SWAG boss chances for extra fun.

Included in boss-mania is a community-made preset for LIGHTHOUSE only (thank you Patty), which adds additional rogues and Goons at WTP.

boss-mania Factory is a surprise :) make sure you take enough ammo and meds...


no-starting-pmcs

This preset removes all starting PMCs and only leaves the dynamic, hot spot PMCs throughout each map. This preset is useful for things like SCAV runs or if you would like to use SWAG PMCs (pmcChance, pmcGroupChance) with Donuts but would also like to keep the extra PMC spawns.


no-pmcs

The preset is for the purists - combine this with SWAG PMC spawns (pmcChance, pmcGroupChance) to fine-tune your PMC spawns. Want a finite number of PMCs in your raids? Only want SCAVs in your raids? This preset is for you.


morepmcs

"live-like" but with more PMCs, fewer SCAVs. Good for PMC kill quests.


morescavs

"live-like" but with more SCAVs, fewer PMCs. Good for SCAV kill quests.


crazyraids

Less spawn variance, most spawns will likely trigger - if you prefer consistent jam-packed action every raid then this preset is for you.

All Donuts spawn point editor options are located in the BepInEx F12 menu. All options you see below are configurable in-raid with Donuts:

```
{
  "MapName": "bigmap",
  "GroupNum": 1,
  "Name": "pmc_trailer_park",
  "Position": {
    "x": -321.211029,
    "y": 0.8538656,
    "z": -231.526016
  },
  "WildSpawnType": "pmc",
  "MinDistance": 1.0,
  "MaxDistance": 5.0,
  "BotTriggerDistance": 400.0,
  "BotTimerTrigger": 3600.0,
  "MaxRandomNumBots": 2,
  "SpawnChance": 80,
  "MaxSpawnsBeforeCoolDown": 2,
  "IgnoreTimerFirstSpawn": true,
  "MinSpawnDistanceFromPlayer": 80
}

"MapName" - name of the map. be sure you use proper names, i.e. "bigmap" for Customs
"GroupNum" - spawn group. all spawns with the same GroupNum will share one trigger. in other words, if you have 3 spawn points in one group, and one of those trigger, then the other 2 won't.
"Name" - name of spawn. you can name them whatever you want
"Position": { - x,y,z coordinates of spawn position. this is provided by the in-raid spawn point editor
  "x": 89.5103455,
  "y": 4.672584,
  "z": -158.156723
}
"WildSpawnType" - bot type, i.e. pmc, sptusec, assault, etc.
"MinDistance" - min spawn point radius (can be 0)
"MaxDistance" - max spawn point radius - this is the size of the spawn point. when using the spawn editor, enable "real size" markers to see the actual radius of your spawn point
"MaxRandomNumBots" - max number of bots to spawn. this is 1-max inclusive and it's random
"BotTriggerDistance" - distance to player for spawn trigger. once the player is within this distance then the spawn timer will start
"BotTimerTrigger" - spawn timer. if the player is within trigger distance this timer will continue to run
"SpawnChance" - spawn chance %
"MaxSpawnsBeforeCooldown" - once this many bots have spawned the spawn point will enter a cooldown (wait for 180s, default, configurable in F12 menu)
"IgnoreTimerFirstSpawn" - if true, once player is within BotTriggerDistance the spawn will trigger regardless of timer. If false, the timer must run at least once for the first spawn trigger.
"MinSpawnDistanceFromPlayer" - the min distance from player that bots should spawn. this is to hopefully prevent bots spawning too close to you.
```

# The Rules of DONUTS

```
Rules
1. Bots will only spawn in same level/height as the spawn marker
2. Bots will only spawn in maximum distance (radius) around the spawn marker
3. One random spawn marker will be picked in a group
 - if the timer is passed its eligible to spawn (Unless IgnoreTimerFirstSpawn is true for the point. It will be set to false after a successful spawn)
 - if they are within the BotTimerTrigger distance the point is eligible to spawn.
 - If the SpawnChance is reached, it is eligible to spawn.
 - Validate that the spawn is not in a wall, in the air, in the player's line of site, minimum distance from the player.  It will attempt to find a valid point up to the Bepinex Configured Max Tries specified.
 - One to MaxRandomNumBots from the Spawn Marker info will be generated of type WildSpawnType
4. Timers will be reset if there is a successful spawn or a failure from within a group.
5. If a spawn sucessfully spawns up to their MaxSpawnsBeforeCooldown number, then it is in 'cooldown' until the timer specified in the bepinex config is reached.

Assumptions
- Spawns within a group will be on/around the same bot trigger distance otherwise only the closest spawn will be enabled.
- Each unique or standalone spawn should be given its own group number.
```
